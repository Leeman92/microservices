# Microservice Challenge
Testing out microservices for a shop 

This is basically a test repository for me to...
* use different programming languages
* dive into the microservice architecture
* use different technologies
  * I'm currently mainly using REST and PHP in my work so why not mix it up?
* using NEW technologies
  * some I haven't used at all like gRCP or GraphQL
* learn the right tools for the job
